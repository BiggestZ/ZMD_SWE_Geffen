they are also the hardest to get into the cauldron! From acclaimed author
Casey Lyall and Caldecott Honor artist Vera Brosgol, A Spoonful of Frogs is
a humorous and wholly original picture book--and a winning recipe for
readers who loved Dragons Love Tacos and Room on the Broom. A witch's
favorite treat is frog soup. Luckily, it's healthy and easy to make. To
give it that extra kick and a pop of color, the key ingredient is a
spoonful of frogs. But how do you keep the frogs on the spoon? They hop,
they leap, they hide . . . and they escape. What is a poor witch to do?
Casey Lyall is a master of comedic timing with her deceptively simple and
energetic text, and Caldecott Honor winnerVera Brosgol's vibrant, hilarious
illustrations make the witch--and the frogs!--practically leap off the
page. The solution to the witch's dilemma will surprise and delight young
readers and their parents alike. Teeming with laugher and hijinks, A
Spoonful of Frogs is pure fun from beginning to end. A must-have for young
