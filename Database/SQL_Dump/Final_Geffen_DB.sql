human memory”—steven\npinker, johnstone professor of psychology, harvard university, author of\nhow the mind works have you ever felt a crushing wave of panic when you\ncan\'t for the life of you remember the name of that actor in the movie you\nsaw last week, or you walk into a room only to forget why you went there in\nthe first place? if you\'re over forty, you\'re probably not laughing. you\nmight even be worried that these lapses in memory could be an early sign of\nalzheimer\'s or dementia. in reality, for the vast majority of us, these\nexamples of forgetting are completely normal. why? because while memory is\namazing, it is far from perfect. our brains aren\'t designed to remember\nevery name we hear, plan we make, or day we experience. just because your\nmemory sometimes fails doesn\'t mean it\'s broken or succumbing to disease.\nforgetting is actually part of being human. in remember, neuroscientist and\nacclaimed novelist lisa genova delves into how memories are made and how we\nretrieve them. you\'ll learn whether forgotten memories are temporarily\ninaccessible or erased forever and why some memories are built to exist for\nonly a few seconds (like a passcode) while others can last a lifetime (your\nwedding day). you\'ll come to appreciate the clear distinction between\nnormal forgetting (where you parked your car) and forgetting due to\nalzheimer\'s (that you own a car). and you\'ll see how memory is profoundly\nimpacted by meaning, emotion, sleep, stress, and context. once you\nunderstand the language of memory and how it functions, its incredible\nstrengths and maddening weaknesses, its natural vulnerabilities and\npotential superpowers, you can both vastly improve your ability to remember\nand feel less rattled when you inevitably forget. you can set educated\nexpectations for your memory, and in doing so, create a better relationship\nwith it. you don\'t have to fear it anymore. and that can be life-changing.'),('9780593178638','pink,blue,and you!','elise gravel','simple, accessible, and direct, this picture book is perfect for kids and\nparents or teachers to read together, opening the door
