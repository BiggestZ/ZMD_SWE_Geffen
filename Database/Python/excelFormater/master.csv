should be discussed with toddlers on up, this read-aloud board book series
offers adults the opportunity to begin important conversations with young
children in an informed, safe, and supported way. Developed by experts in
the fields of early childhood and activism against injustice, this topic-
driven board book offers clear, concrete language and beautiful imagery
that young children can grasp and adults can leverage for further
discussion. While young children are avid observers and questioners of
their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on
complicated topics because it's hard to know where to begin. Research shows
that talking about issues like race and gender from the age of two not only
helps children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness,
self-esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are
unfair, like discrimination and prejudice. This second book in the series
begins the conversation on gender, with a supportive approach that
considers both the child and the adult. Stunning art accompanies the simple
and interactive text, and the backmatter offers additional resources and

consent—from author Carrie Finison and the #1 New York Times bestselling
illustrator of The World Needs More Purple People, Daniel Wiseman. Doug
doesn't like hugs. He thinks hugs are too squeezy, too squashy, too
squooshy, too smooshy. He doesn't like hello hugs or goodbye hugs, game-
winning home run hugs or dropped ice cream cone hugs, and he definitely
doesn't like birthday hugs. He'd much rather give a high five--or a low
five, a side five, a double five, or a spinny five. Yup, some people love
hugs; other people don't. So how can you tell if someone likes hugs or not?

themselves whether they want a hug or not.",[],"[['body', 'bodily autonomy', 'consent'], ['different:individual differences'], ['personal space:personal space'], ['language:rhyming']]"

for holiday gift-giving and stocking stuffing! It's December 24th, and the
old farmer settles down for a winter's nap, wondering how Christmas can
come when there is no snow! In his dream he imagines a snowstorm covering
him and his animals—named One, Two, Three, Four and Five—in a snowy
blanket. But when the farmer awakens, he finds that it has really snowed
outside, and now he remembers something! Putting on his red suit, he goes
outside and places gifts under the tree for his animals, bringing holiday
cheer to all. Clever lift-the-flaps reveal the animals hidden under the
snow in the farmer's dream, making this board book edition a treat for all
ages. Praise for Dream Snow: ""Few in number are the parents who have made
it through their toddler's years on just one copy of Carle's The Very
Hungry Caterpillar. Dream Snow has similar ingredients: a simple story,
lively collage-like illustrations and a fun gimmick for little hands . . .""

hopes, her passion, her strength, and her stories with her, when she came
to the United States in 1994 with her infant son. She left behind nearly
everything she owned, but she didn't come empty-handed. From the author-
illustrator of Bright Star, Dreamers is a celebration of making your home
with the things you always carry: your resilience, your dreams, your hopes
and history. It's the story of finding your way in a new place, of
navigating an unfamiliar world and finding the best parts of it. In dark
times, it's a promise that you can make better tomorrows. This lovingly-
illustrated picture book memoir looks at the myriad gifts migrantes bring
with them when they leave their homes. It's a story about family. And it's
a story to remind us that we are all dreamers, bringing our own strengths
wherever we roam. Beautiful and powerful at any time but given particular
urgency as the status of our own Dreamers becomes uncertain, this is a
story that is both topical and timeless. The lyrical text is complemented
by sumptuously detailed illustrations, rich in symbolism. Also included are
a brief autobiographical essay about Yuyi's own experience, a list of books
that inspired her (and still do), and a description of the beautiful
images, textures, and mementos she used to create this book. A parallel
Spanish-language edition, Soñadores, is also available. Winner of the Pura

school, the principal said, ""NO."" When she wanted her teaching license, the
New York Board of Education said, ""NO."" Judy and people with disabilities
everywhere were tired of hearing ""NO."" In the 1970s an important disability
rights law, Section 504 of The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, was waiting to
be signed. Judy and other disability rights activists fought for ""YES!""
They held a sit-in until Section 504 was signed into law. Section 504 laid
the foundation for the American with Disabilities Act, which was
established thanks in large part to the ongoing work of Judy and her
community. Along with a personal reflection from Judy herself, this picture
book biography captures the impact and influence of one of America's

and literature seen through the sharp, contemporary lens of New Yorker
cartoonist and comics sensation Kate Beaton. No era or tome emerges
unscathed as Beaton rightly skewers the Western world's revolutionaries,
leaders, sycophants, and suffragists while equally honing her wit on the
hapless heroes, heroines, and villains of the best-loved fiction. She
deftly points out what really happened when Brahms fell asleep listening to
Liszt, that the world's first hipsters were obviously the Incroyables and
the Merveilleuses from eighteenth-century France, that Susan B. Anthony is,
of course, a ""Samantha,"" and that the polite banality of Canadian culture
never gets old. Hark! A Vagrant features sexy Batman, the true stories
behind classic Nancy Drew covers, and Queen Elizabeth doing the albatross.

should be discussed with toddlers on up, this read-aloud board book series
offers adults the opportunity to begin important conversations with young
children in an informed, safe, and supported way. Developed by experts in
the fields of early childhood and activism against injustice, this topic-
driven board book offers clear, concrete language and beautiful imagery
that young children can grasp and adults can leverage for further
discussion. While young children are avid observers and questioners of
their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on
complicated topics because it's hard to know where to begin. Research shows
that talking about issues like race and gender from the age of two not only
helps children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness,
self-esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are
unfair, like discrimination and prejudice. This first book in the series
begins the conversation on race, with a supportive approach that considers
both the child and the adult. Stunning art accompanies the simple and
interactive text, and the backmatter offers additional resources and ideas
for extending this discussion.",[],

brave knight come together to defeat a terrible monster and in the process

the princesses they met. While they were away, a terrible dragon threatened
their land, and all the soldiers fled. The prince rushed back to save his
kingdom from the perilous beast and was met by a brave knight in a suit of
brightly shining armor. Together they fought the dragon and discovered that
special something the prince was looking for all along. This book is

9780593137956,Remember,Joy Harjo,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A fascinating exploration of the intricacies of
how we remember, why we forget, and what we can do to protect our memories,
from the Harvard-trained neuroscientist and bestselling author of Still
Alice. “Using her expertise as a neuroscientist and her gifts as a
storyteller, Lisa Genova explains the nuances of human memory”—Steven
Pinker, Johnstone Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, author of
How the Mind Works Have you ever felt a crushing wave of panic when you
can't for the life of you remember the name of that actor in the movie you
saw last week, or you walk into a room only to forget why you went there in
the first place? If you're over forty, you're probably not laughing. You
might even be worried that these lapses in memory could be an early sign of
Alzheimer's or dementia. In reality, for the vast majority of us, these
examples of forgetting are completely normal. Why? Because while memory is
amazing, it is far from perfect. Our brains aren't designed to remember
every name we hear, plan we make, or day we experience. Just because your
memory sometimes fails doesn't mean it's broken or succumbing to disease.
Forgetting is actually part of being human. In Remember, neuroscientist and
acclaimed novelist Lisa Genova delves into how memories are made and how we
retrieve them. You'll learn whether forgotten memories are temporarily
inaccessible or erased forever and why some memories are built to exist for
only a few seconds (like a passcode) while others can last a lifetime (your
wedding day). You'll come to appreciate the clear distinction between
normal forgetting (where you parked your car) and forgetting due to
Alzheimer's (that you own a car). And you'll see how memory is profoundly
impacted by meaning, emotion, sleep, stress, and context. Once you
understand the language of memory and how it functions, its incredible
strengths and maddening weaknesses, its natural vulnerabilities and
potential superpowers, you can both vastly improve your ability to remember
and feel less rattled when you inevitably forget. You can set educated
expectations for your memory, and in doing so, create a better relationship
with it. You don't have to fear it anymore. And that can be life-changing.",[],"[['perception', 'use of color'], ['family', 'connection'], ['culture', 'memory'], ['family:generations']]"

Award'winning director William Friedkin secured his place as a great
filmmaker. A maverick from the start, Friedkin joined other young directors
who ushered in Hollywood's second Golden Age during the 1970s. Now, in his
long-awaited memoir, Friedkin provides a candid portrait of an
extraordinary life and career. His own success story has the makings of
classic American film. He was born in Chicago, the son of Russian
immigrants. Immediately after high school, he found work in the mailroom of
a local television station, and patiently worked his way into the directing
booth during the heyday of live TV. An award-winning documentary brought
him attention as a talented new filmmaker, as well as an advocate for
justice, and it caught the eye of producer David L. Wolper, who brought
Friedkin to Los Angeles. There he moved from television (one of the last
episodes of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour) to film (The Birthday Party, The
Boys in the Band), displaying a versatile stylistic range. Released in
1971, The French Connection won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture
and Best Director, and two years later, The Exorcist received ten Oscar
nominations and catapulted Friedkin's career to stardom. Penned by the
director himself, The Friedkin Connection takes listeners on a journey
through the numerous chance encounters and unplanned occurrences that led a
young man from a poor urban neighborhood to success in one of the most
competitive industries and art forms in the world. Written with the
narrative drive of one of his finest films, The Friedkin Connection is a
wonderfully engaging look at an artist and an industry that has transformed
who we are ? and how we see ourselves.",[],

should be discussed with toddlers on up, this read-aloud board book series
offers adults the opportunity to begin important conversations with young
children in an informed, safe, and supported way. Developed by experts in
the fields of early childhood development and activism against injustice,
this topic-driven book offers clear, concrete language and imagery to
introduce the concept of consent. This book serves to normalize and
celebrate the experience of asking for and being asked for permission to do
something involving one's body. It centers on respect for bodily autonomy,
and reviews the many ways that one can say or indicate ""No."" While young
children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often
shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because it's hard
to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about issues like race,
gender, and our bodies from the age of two not only helps children
understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem,
and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair, like
discrimination and prejudice. These books offer a supportive approach that
considers both the child and the adult. Illustrative art accompanies the
simple and interactive text, and the backmatter offers additional resources
and ideas for extending this discussion.",['Bodily autonomy/consent'],

points for making the world more fair for all! While young children are
avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often shut down or
postpone conversations on complicated topics because it's hard to know
where to begin. Research shows that talking about issues like race and

see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem, and allows them to
recognize and confront things that are unfair, like discrimination and
prejudice. These books offer a supportive approach that considers both the

opportunity to begin important conversations with young children in an
informed, safe, and supported way. Developed by experts in the fields of
early childhood and activism against injustice, this topic-driven board
book offers clear, concrete language and beautiful imagery that young
children can grasp and adults can leverage for further discussion. While
young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults
often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because
it's hard to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about issues
like love, relationships, and families from the age of two not only helps
children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-
esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair,
like discrimination and prejudice. This fourth book in the series begins
the conversation on love with a supportive approach that considers both the
child and the adult. Stunning art accompanies the simple and interactive

speed of sound: one language when talking to Sumi's grandmother, another
when she addresses the cashier. Sometimes with Sumi she speaks a
combination of both. Could it be she possesses a superpower? With awe and
curiosity, young Sumi recounts the story of her mother's migration from
India and how she came to acquire two tongues, now woven together like fine
cloth. Rahele Jomepour Bell's inviting illustrations make playful use of
visual metaphors, while Uma Menon's lyrical text, told astutely from a
child's perspective, touches lightly on such subjects as linguistic
diversity and accent discrimination (""no matter how they speak, every
person's voice is unique and important""). This welcome debut, penned when

determined to read that he invented his own alphabet. **Winner of a

he lost his sight. He was a clever boy, determined to live like everyone
else, and what he wanted more than anything was to be able to read. Even at
the school for the blind in Paris, there were no books for him. And so he
invented his own alphabet—a whole new system for writing that could be read
by touch. A system so ingenious that it is still used by the blind
community today. Award-winning writer Jen Bryant tells Braille’s inspiring
story with a lively and accessible text, filled with the sounds, the
smells, and the touch of Louis’s world. Boris Kulikov’s inspired paintings
help readers to understand what Louis lost, and what he was determined to
gain back through books. An author’s note and additional resources at the
end of the book complement the simple story and offer more information for

9781592704064,there was a shadow,Bruce Handy,"From the author of New York Times Best Children's Book The Happiness of a
Dog with a Ball in Its Mouth, a luminous picture book about the shadows,
both literal and emotional, that accompany us throughout our day There was
a shadow. It was a new shadow, but also the last hint of night. It was a
morning shadow. As the sun makes its daily journey across the sky, light
comes down to illuminate our world. Moving and dancing along with this
light come a variety of shadows--those cast by the sun and those cast by
our feelings, minds, and memories. Here we follow a girl from dawn through
dusk into night as she and her friends play with their shadows, take refuge
in the shade of a large tree, and set out again for home in the violet glow
of twilight. With a lyrical text from Bruce Handy and dramatic, sensitive
art from Lisk Feng, this book invites readers to look up and down, in and
out--to notice the position of the sun and the corresponding length or
shortness of shadows, as well as the subtle ways in which light and shadow
reveal and obscure things both in the world and in ourselves. With images
that swell and overflow with light, this is a picture book that is sure to
awe and delight.",[],"[['perception', 'grouping', 'figure-ground segregation', 'shadow'], ['contrast'], ['perception:relative size'], ['language:adjectives'], ['perception:motion perception'], ['social:friendship'], ['emotions:emotions'], ['family:Time']]"

who are ready to take on the world to thirteen inspirational women who
never took no for an answer, and who always, inevitably and without fail,
persisted. Throughout United States history, there have always been women
who have spoken out for what's right, even when they have to fight to be
heard. In this book, Chelsea Clinton celebrates thirteen American women who
helped shape our country through their tenacity, sometimes through speaking
out, sometimes by staying seated, sometimes by captivating an audience.
They all certainly persisted. She Persisted is for everyone who has ever
wanted to speak up but has been told to quiet down, for everyone who has
ever tried to reach for the stars but was told to sit down, and for
everyone who has ever been made to feel unworthy or unimportant or small.
With vivid, compelling art by Alexandra Boiger, this book shows readers
that no matter what obstacles may be in their paths, they shouldn't give up
on their dreams. Persistence is power. This book features: Harriet Tubman,
Helen Keller, Clara Lemlich, Nellie Bly, Virginia Apgar, Maria Tallchief,
Claudette Colvin, Ruby Bridges, Margaret Chase Smith, Sally Ride, Florence
Griffith Joyner, Oprah Winfrey, Sonia Sotomayor—and one special cameo.

friendship, and all the different ways we make a new place feel like home.
For Ren, home is his grandmother's little house, and the lush forest that
surrounds it. Home is a place of magic and wonder, filled with all the
fantastical friends that Ren dreams up. Home is where his imagination can
run wild. For Ava, home is a brick and cement city, where there's always
something to do or see or hear. Home is a place bursting with life, where
people bustle in and out like a big parade. Home is where Ava is never
lonely because there's always someone to share in her adventures. When Ren
moves to Ava's city, he feels lost without his wild. How will he ever feel
at home in a place with no green and no magic, where everything is exactly
what it seems? Of course, not everything in the city is what meets the eye,
and as Ren discovers, nothing makes you feel at home quite like a friend.
Inspired by the stories her father told her about moving from Puerto Rico
to New York as a child, Zara González Hoang's author-illustrator debut is
an imaginative exploration of the true meaning of ""home.""",[],"[['perception', 'shadow'], ['change'], ['perception:motion perception'], ['imagination:imagination'], ['language:alliteration'], ['emotions:loneliness'], ['changing perspective:changing perspective'], ['social:making friends'], ['social:belonging'], ['emotions:curiosity'], ['emotions:homesickness'], ['perception:continuity']]"

topics should be discussed with toddlers on up, this read-aloud series
offers adults the opportunity to begin important conversations with young
children in an informed, safe, and supported way. Developed by experts in
the fields of early childhood and activism, this topic-driven picture book
offers clear, concrete language and compelling imagery to introduce the
concept of justice. This book aims to ground the idea of justice within the
responsibilities and benefits of being part of a healthy community. While
young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults
often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because
it's hard to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about tough
issues from the age of two not only helps children understand what they
see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem, and allows them to
recognize and confront things that are unfair, like discrimination and
prejudice. These books offer a supportive approach that considers both the
child and the adult. Stunning art accompanies the simple and interactive
text, and the backmatter offers additional resources and ideas for
extending this discussion.",['cooperation/working together'],"[['moral development'], ['cognition', 'problem-solving'], ['social', 'justice'], ['punishment'], ['zone of proximal development'], ['safety'], ['community:community'], ['emotions:emotions'], ['conflict:conflict'], ['growth:growth']]"
