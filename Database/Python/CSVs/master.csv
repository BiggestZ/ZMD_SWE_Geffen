should be discussed with toddlers on up, this read-aloud board book series
offers adults the opportunity to begin important conversations with young
children in an informed, safe, and supported way. developed by experts in
the fields of early childhood and activism against injustice, this topic-
driven board book offers clear, concrete language and beautiful imagery
that young children can grasp and adults can leverage for further
discussion. while young children are avid observers and questioners of
their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on
complicated topics because it's hard to know where to begin. research shows
that talking about issues like race and gender from the age of two not only
helps children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness,
self-esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are
unfair, like discrimination and prejudice. this first book in the series
begins the conversation on race, with a supportive approach that considers
both the child and the adult. stunning art accompanies the simple and
interactive text, and the backmatter offers additional resources and ideas
for extending this discussion.",[],nan,english

9780593137956.0,remember,joy harjo,"new york times bestseller • a fascinating exploration of the intricacies of
how we remember, why we forget, and what we can do to protect our memories,
from the harvard-trained neuroscientist and bestselling author of still
alice. “using her expertise as a neuroscientist and her gifts as a
storyteller, lisa genova explains the nuances of human memory”—steven
pinker, johnstone professor of psychology, harvard university, author of
how the mind works have you ever felt a crushing wave of panic when you
can't for the life of you remember the name of that actor in the movie you
saw last week, or you walk into a room only to forget why you went there in
the first place? if you're over forty, you're probably not laughing. you
might even be worried that these lapses in memory could be an early sign of
alzheimer's or dementia. in reality, for the vast majority of us, these
examples of forgetting are completely normal. why? because while memory is
amazing, it is far from perfect. our brains aren't designed to remember
every name we hear, plan we make, or day we experience. just because your
memory sometimes fails doesn't mean it's broken or succumbing to disease.
forgetting is actually part of being human. in remember, neuroscientist and
acclaimed novelist lisa genova delves into how memories are made and how we
retrieve them. you'll learn whether forgotten memories are temporarily
inaccessible or erased forever and why some memories are built to exist for
only a few seconds (like a passcode) while others can last a lifetime (your
wedding day). you'll come to appreciate the clear distinction between
normal forgetting (where you parked your car) and forgetting due to
alzheimer's (that you own a car). and you'll see how memory is profoundly
impacted by meaning, emotion, sleep, stress, and context. once you
understand the language of memory and how it functions, its incredible
strengths and maddening weaknesses, its natural vulnerabilities and
potential superpowers, you can both vastly improve your ability to remember
and feel less rattled when you inevitably forget. you can set educated
expectations for your memory, and in doing so, create a better relationship
with it. you don't have to fear it anymore. and that can be life-changing.",[],"[['perception', 'use of color'], ['family', 'connection'], ['culture', 'memory'], ['family:generations']]",english

award'winning director william friedkin secured his place as a great
filmmaker. a maverick from the start, friedkin joined other young directors
who ushered in hollywood's second golden age during the 1970s. now, in his
long-awaited memoir, friedkin provides a candid portrait of an
extraordinary life and career. his own success story has the makings of
classic american film. he was born in chicago, the son of russian
immigrants. immediately after high school, he found work in the mailroom of
a local television station, and patiently worked his way into the directing
booth during the heyday of live tv. an award-winning documentary brought
him attention as a talented new filmmaker, as well as an advocate for
justice, and it caught the eye of producer david l. wolper, who brought
friedkin to los angeles. there he moved from television (one of the last
episodes of the alfred hitchcock hour) to film (the birthday party, the
boys in the band), displaying a versatile stylistic range. released in
1971, the french connection won five academy awards, including best picture
and best director, and two years later, the exorcist received ten oscar
nominations and catapulted friedkin's career to stardom. penned by the
director himself, the friedkin connection takes listeners on a journey
through the numerous chance encounters and unplanned occurrences that led a
young man from a poor urban neighborhood to success in one of the most
competitive industries and art forms in the world. written with the
narrative drive of one of his finest films, the friedkin connection is a
wonderfully engaging look at an artist and an industry that has transformed

should be discussed with toddlers on up, this read-aloud board book series
offers adults the opportunity to begin important conversations with young
children in an informed, safe, and supported way. developed by experts in
the fields of early childhood development and activism against injustice,
this topic-driven book offers clear, concrete language and imagery to
introduce the concept of consent. this book serves to normalize and
celebrate the experience of asking for and being asked for permission to do
something involving one's body. it centers on respect for bodily autonomy,
and reviews the many ways that one can say or indicate ""no."" while young
children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often
shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because it's hard
to know where to begin. research shows that talking about issues like race,
gender, and our bodies from the age of two not only helps children
understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem,
and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair, like
discrimination and prejudice. these books offer a supportive approach that
considers both the child and the adult. illustrative art accompanies the

young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults

like love, relationships, and families from the age of two not only helps
children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-
esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair,
like discrimination and prejudice. this fourth book in the series begins

make his way in the world? fortunately for willie, the music saved him and
brought him back into the light. his powerful voice, combined with the
wailing of his slide guitar, moved people. willie made a name for himself
performing on street corners all over texas. and one day he hit it big when
he got a record deal and his songs were played on the radio. then in 1977,
his song--""dark was the night""--was chosen to light up the darkness when it
was launched into space on the voyager i space probe's famous golden
record. his immortal song was selected for the way it expresses the

boy, emmanuel hopped to school more than two miles each way, learned to
play soccer, left home at age thirteen to provide for his family, and,

across ghana in 2001, spreading his powerful message: disability is not

offers adults the opportunity to begin important conversations with young
children in an informed, safe, and supported way. developed by experts in
the fields of early childhood and activism, this topic-driven picture book
offers clear, concrete language and compelling imagery to introduce the
concept of justice. this book aims to ground the idea of justice within the
responsibilities and benefits of being part of a healthy community. while
young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults
often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because
it's hard to know where to begin. research shows that talking about tough
issues from the age of two not only helps children understand what they
see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem, and allows them to
recognize and confront things that are unfair, like discrimination and
prejudice. these books offer a supportive approach that considers both the
child and the adult. stunning art accompanies the simple and interactive
